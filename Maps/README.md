## Folder Overview

This folder contains one example map for each category defined in the building typology. Each map provides a Satellite View and a Google Street View of the sampled buildings. To learn more about the typologies used in SUBDENSE project, please check [Building_Typology](../Building_Typology.md) file.

### Map Creation Process
Maps are created using [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.4.2/windows/64-bit/msi/?redirected=1)â€”both open-source software. Selected building footprints and base layers were exported from QGIS in SVG format. Inkscape was used to style the maps and add map elements and views. The final maps were saved as PNG images.
