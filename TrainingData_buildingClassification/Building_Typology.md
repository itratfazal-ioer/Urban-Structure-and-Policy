## 1. Detached Apartment Building 
#### Code MFH-F, Type 12
Small apartment building, not attached to adjacent structures. This building type is often difficult to distinguish from [Type 31](#7-single-family-house) due to similar size and form. However, certain indicators can assist in classification. Unlike Type 31, Type 12 typically lacks a surrounding garden area. The presence of multiple balconies and a significant number of parking spaces may also suggest this typology.
