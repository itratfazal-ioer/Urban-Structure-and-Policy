# Building Typology Used in Training Data Production

The training data was producted focusing on a defined set of building typologies. These typologies represent patterns and characteristics observed in various urban and rural settings in context to Germany. 

Below is a description of each typology followed by an example map.

## 1. Detached Apartment Building 
#### Code MFH-F, Type 12
Small apartment building, not attached to adjacent structures. This building type is often difficult to distinguish from Type 31 due to similar size and form. However, certain indicators can assist in classification. Unlike Type 31, Type 12 typically lacks a surrounding garden area. The presence of multiple balconies and a significant number of parking spaces may also suggest this typology.
